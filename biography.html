	<h2>Childhood</h2>

	<p>Rahul Dev Burman, better known as R.D. Burman, was a famous Bollywood music director during the 60's through the early 90's.  He was known for introducing an upbeat, Western copied music that defined much of the music of the 1970's.  This style has influenced generations of music directors even to today. R.D. Burman was born in Calcutta on June 27th, 1939, in Calcutta.  RD Burman was born to the Bollywood composer/singer Sachin Dev Burman and his lyricist wife Meera Dev Burman in Kolkata. His father was the legendary music director S.D. Burman and his mother was named Meera.  Initially, he was nicknamed Tublu by his maternal grandmother As a child he was nicknamed "Pancham".  There seems to be some disagreement as to how he acquired this nickname.  One story has it that as an infant, his crying reminded his parents of the fifth note of the Indian scale; this is known as Pancham.  Another story has it that once when Ashok Kumar was visiting, the he kept saying "Pa Pa, Pa, Pa" and whereupon Ashok Kumar named him "Pancham".

	His professional career began in 1958.  He began assisting his father on films such as "Solva Saal" (1958), "Chalti Ka Naaam Gaadi" (1958), and "Kaagaz ka Phool" (1957).  His first film as music director was Guru Dutt's film "Raaz" (1959); unfortunately, this film was shelved in the middle of the project.  His first released film as a music director was Mehmood's "Chote Nawaab" (1961).  From there his career was firmly launched. The 1960's saw RD. Burman working in various capacities.  Sometimes he worked as an assistant music director to his father; he assisted his father on such films as "Bandini" (1963), "Teen Deviyaan" (1965), "Guide" (1965), "Jewel Thief" (1967) and "Talash" (1969).  He also tried his hand at acting; he acted in such films as "Bhoot Bangla" (1965) and "Pyaar Ka Mausam" (1967).  But more significantly he started working as a music director in his own right.  For instance, there was "Bhoot Bangla" (1965), and his first hit film "Teesri Manzil"  Burman gave credit to lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri for recommending him to Nasir Hussain, the producer and writer of the film. Vijay Anand also said that he had arranged a music session for Burman before Nasir Hussain. Teesri Manzil had six songs, all of which were written by Majrooh Sultanpuri, and sung by Mohammed Rafi. Four of these were duets with Asha Bhosle, whom Burman later married. Nasir Hussain went on to sign RD Burman and lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri for six of his films including Baharon Ke Sapne (1967), Pyar Ka Mausam (1969) and Yaadon Ki Baaraat (1973). Burman's score forzsos Padosan (1968) was well received. Meanwhile, he continued to work as his father's assistant for movies like Jewel Thief(1967) , "Waris" (1969) and Prem Pujari (1970). The dawn of the 70s saw, RD Burman become Bollywood's most sought after music director.  This was represented by such immortal hits as "Amar Prem" (1971), "Hare Rama Hare Krishna" (1971), "Seetha Aur Geeta" (1972), and "Sholay" (1975).

	During the late 1980s, RD Burman was overshadowed by Bappi Lahiri and other disco music composers.[15] Many filmmakers stopped patronizing him, as films featuring his compositions flopped at the box office one after the other.[6][10] Nasir Hussain, who had signed him up for every single of his productions since Teesri Manzil (1966), did not sign him up for Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak (1988).[6] Hussain defended RD Burman in press, saying that the latter did not give weak music inZamane Ko Dikhana Hai (1982) and Manzil Manzil (1984). He also said that the composer was going through a lean phase during the recording of Zabardast(1985).[16] But after these three films flopped, Hussain stepped down as a director, and his son and successor Mansoor Khan switched to other composers. The filmmaker Subhash Ghai promised RD Burman Ram Lakhan (1989), but gave it instead to Laxmikant-Pyarelal, who had earlier played in Burman's orchestra.[6] In 1986, RD Burman composed songs for Ijaazat; the score is regarded as one of his best. However, the film belonged to the Parallel Cinema genre of (art films), so it did not stop the decline of RD Burman's commercial film career. All four of the songs in Ijaazat were sung by Asha Bhosle and written by Gulzar. RD Burman was greatly appreciated by the critics for setting the non-rhyming lyrics of the song Mera Kuchh Saamaan to the music. While both Asha Bhosle (Best Female Playback) and Gulzar (Best Lyrics) received National Awards for the score, RD Burman received none.[17] RD Burman suffered from a heart attack in 1988, and underwent heart bypass surgery a year later at The Princess Grace Hospital in London.[18] During this period, he composed many tunes, which were never released. He composed music for Vidhu Vinod Chopra's movie Parinda in 1989. He composed one song called Chhod Ke Na Jaana which was sung by Asha Bhosle for the movie Gang. But since the movie took too long to release and due to his untimely death, director Mazhar Khansigned in the then little known Anu Malik for the music of the movie. Thenmavin Kombath, a Malayalam film by Priyadarshan was the last film he signed, but he died before he could score for the film. The music of 1942: A Love Story (1994) was released after his death, and was highly successful. It posthumously won him the third and last of his Filmfare Awards. As per Lata Mangeshkar, he died too young and unhappy.
