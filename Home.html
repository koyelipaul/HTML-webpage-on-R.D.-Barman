   <span style="font-size: 170%;">R</span>ahul Dev Burman (27 June 1939-4 January 1994) was an Indian film score composer, 
   who is considered one of the seminal music directors of the Indian film industry.Nicknamed Pancham da, 
   he was the only son of the composer Sachin Dev Burman. From the 1960s to the 1990s, RD Burman composed musical scores for
   331 movies.He was mainly active in the Hindi film industry as a composer, and also provided vocals for a few of compositions.
   Though Burman laid the foundation for numerous Bollywood music directors to pave the path for the future of music in Bollywood cinema, 
   he was awarded a total of only three Filmfare Awards, one of which was awarded posthumously (for 1942: A Love Story). 
   Several Hindi movies made after RD Burman's death contain his original songs or their remixed versions.
 
        
Dil Vil Pyar Vyar (2002), which contains several re-arranged hit songs of Burman, 
was made as a tribute to him.[28] Jhankaar Beats (2003), which catapulted the music director duo Vishal-Shekhar into the limelight, 
is also a tribute to him.[29] In Khwahish (2003), Mallika Sherawat's character is an RD Burman fan; the movie features repeated references 
to RD Burman.[30] In 2010, Brahmanand Singh released a 113-minute documentary titled Pancham Unmixed: Mujhe Chalte Jaana Hai, 
which received critical acclaim. The music of Lootera (2013) is a tribute to RD Burman.[31] Other films which credit 
RD Burman include Gang (2000) and Monsoon Wedding (2001, for Chura liya hai).
